## Project Overview

WindWise is a data visualization and analysis tool designed to help users better understand and predict wind data patterns. Created as part of the InnovateHacks2.0 online hackathon, this app allows users to upload wind turbine data, explore trends, and even forecast future wind speeds using predictive modeling techniques. 

### Key Features
- **Dark Mode Toggle:** User-friendly dark mode option for improved accessibility.
- **Data Upload:** Upload your own CSV files for analysis.
- **Data Exploration & EDA:** View raw data, basic statistics, and visualize trends through rolling means, scatter plots, and time series plots.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Linear Regression and ARIMA forecasting for wind speed predictions.

## Technical Overview
The app is built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), allowing for a smooth and interactive experience. It uses various data science libraries, including `pandas` for data handling, `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for visualizations, and `scikit-learn` for linear regression modeling. The app also includes ARIMA modeling from `statsmodels` to analyze wind speed time series data.

### Libraries and Dependencies
- **Python Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`, `streamlit`
- **Framework:** Streamlit for building and hosting the app
- **Front-End Styling:** CSS and HTML to customize the app's appearance, including dark mode and animated wind turbine graphics.

## Using the App
1. **Upload Data:** Select the **WindWise** page, then upload a CSV file containing wind turbine data.
2. **Explore Data:** Examine raw data, view basic statistics, and observe trends over time with available EDA options.
3. **Run Predictive Models:** Check out the **Modeling & Prediction** tab to apply linear regression and ARIMA forecasting models on your data.
4. **View the About Me Page:** Learn more about the project author and explore GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement additional models for better forecasting accuracy.
- Add storage options for user-uploaded data.
- Explore more complex visualizations and insights.
